# Leave a Tide Pool
A LeechBlock block list for my “Leave a Tide Pool” challenge

Here is a fun idea I had: avoid using a website, app, or service of your choice, from the following categories:

- all social media
- all search engines
- all of your bookmarked sites

of course, you can do smaller, too:

- avoid one social media service you use everyday
- avoid using the search engine you use most
- don’t follow links to websites you know or trust

and, pick the length for how long:

- a week
- a month
- your call!
